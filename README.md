# Random_Walks

## Introduction 
RandomWalks uses Python to create a visual representation of data. It generates a 'random walk' path with random directions that is determined by a series of random decisions.

The image shown above is an example of RandomWalks. The green circle represents the start of the path at (0,0) axis. The path generates dots around the graph at random directions until a certain amount of plots have bee made. The graph also shows that some dots are darker/lighter then others. The lighter dots represents the initial path as it slowly gets darker towards the Red dot (The red dot is the last dot and represents the end of the path). This generates a path.
